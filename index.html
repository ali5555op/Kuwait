        <h2>Economy</h2>
        <p>Kuwait’s economy is primarily driven by its vast oil reserves, which form the backbone of its wealth and global
            economic influence. As one of the world's top oil producers, Kuwait's petroleum sector not only fuels its own
             economy but also plays a crucial role in the global energy market. The country has strategically invested oil
              revenues into infrastructure, financial services, and real estate, fostering a diverse and modern economy. Efforts 
              to diversify beyond oil, such as initiatives in the financial sector and tourism development, are increasingly
               shaping Kuwait's economic landscape. Despite its reliance on hydrocarbons, Kuwait’s economic resilience and 
               strategic investments aim to ensure long-term stability and growth, positioning it as a significant player
                in the regional and global economy.

    <section id="history">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Kuwait's history is a rich narrative shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of trade routes between
             the Arabian Peninsula and the rest of the world. Originally a modest fishing and trading settlement in the 18th
              century, Kuwait rapidly developed into a bustling port city thanks to its advantageous position and growing
               maritime trade. The discovery of oil in the 1930s marked a transformative period, propelling Kuwait from a
                regional player to a key global economic force. Throughout the 20th century, Kuwait experienced significant
                 social and economic changes, including gaining independence from Britain in 1961 and facing the turmoil
                  of the Iraqi invasion in 1990. The subsequent liberation and reconstruction efforts led to a renewed focus
                   on modernization and economic diversification, reflecting Kuwait's resilience and evolving role on the 
                   world stage.</p>
